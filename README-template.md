## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I thought this was going to be a fairly straightforward project but it took me a long time to figure out how to control the state of the percent variable as it was coming in from a button input and also a number input. I admittedly hacked my way through that part. :()
